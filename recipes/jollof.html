    <h1>Jollof Rice</h1>
    <h2>Description:The traditional Nigerian Jollof dish</h2>
    <p1>Because Jollof Rice is Bae, and much loved South of the Sahara and along the coast of West Africa.
        Spiced and stewed in a flavorful tomato broth, it is everything from "everyday" to celebration. 
        The classic version is cooked with long-grain rice (Uncle Ben's/Carolina's) 
        and seasoned with Nigerian-style curry powder and dried thyme. Served with fried, ripe plantains which we call dodo and coleslaw, it is everything. </p1>
    <p2>
        Learning to make Jollof was a rite of passage for me and I've gone through so many iterations each 
        time trying to streamline the process while delivering the most flavour.</p2>
